"""Bootstrap stub - docs/imp_design.md §2.4 (supersedes the pre-WP-03
~516-line build orchestrator, now `adas_build_tools`, published from
`modules/toolchain` and installed per-component via pip+venv).

Physically identical across every component in this repo (df, vdy,
interfaces, mathlib, perception-core, shared_config, sim) - propagating a
future fix means editing modules/toolchain/copy_files/scripts/build.py,
running sync_copy_files.py, and committing the fan-out into every
component's own repo (R-BUILD-6), same discipline as build.bat/build.sh.

Runs on bare system Python, stdlib only (venv, subprocess, pathlib, sys,
os, time) - it cannot assume anything else is installed yet, that's the
whole reason this file stays this small. Its only job: find or create a
.venv, make sure the pinned version of adas_build_tools is installed into
it, then exec into it and forward argv/exit-code untouched - never any
build logic of its own.

Usage: python build.py -t <target> -p <platform> [-P <project>] [--clean]
